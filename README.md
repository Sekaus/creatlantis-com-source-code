# ======================| READ ME IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK |======================
When you have cloned the repository, you need some extra files to make it work:
- 1 This website uses Amazon Web Service S3 as its file server, so you need to get the PHP SDK (https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/) as a folder named "aws" inside of "public" > "php_functions" under
- 2 You need to set up your own MySQL server with all the tables, data rows, and columns. Keep in mind that it is case-sensitive.
- 3 Add your own db_connect.php with the needed PHP functions to use to connect to the database of your own, and add it to "public" > "php_functions" > "mysql_functions"
