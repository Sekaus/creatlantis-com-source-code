            <li><h3>Content and Posting Rules</h3>
                <ol><li><h4>Allowed Content</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Remember to add the right tags on your posts and add trigger warnings if it is NSFW (not safe for work) like nudity or gore, etc.. or if they can trigger users with epilepsy, like flashing gif files (but they do not need to be tagged as NSFW).</li>
                            <li>Commissions and adoptions with the proper description of product and payment methods and rewards (what you get when you pay and how).</li>
                            <li>Competitions and raffles with clear rules and prizes.</li>
                            <li>Personal blogs, journals, images, or links to games you made or wanna share are allowed. If you want to share stuff you fund on the side or anywhere else, remember to ask for permission from the original owner of the product and give them credit if they ask you to do.</li>
                            <li>All content on the side should comply with applicable laws and our user policy.</li>
                            <li>Objective or subjective political blogs or debates is allowed.</li>
                            <li>Both SFW (safe for work) and NSFW (not safe for work) content is allowed.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Tagging your content with misleading tags, such as using the tag SFW (safe for work) when it is clearly NSFW (not safe for work).

            <li><h3>Marketing and Seller's Risks</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Commissions and Adoptions</h4>
                        <p>
                            When you create a commission or adoption where you put your artwork up for sale and maybe show an example of your artwork to show what you are selling in the form of a picture,
                            a piece of some text in some of your literature, some clips from a video or gif files,
                            there is always a risk of people on the side and off the side can steal what you have promoted without paying and without your permission and maybe even try to resell,
                            modify it or re-uploaded it to a third party without your written permission. You can try putting a watermark over what you show so that when other people try to copy it,
                            people can see that they don't own it. <strong>BUT</strong> even doing that doesn't guarantee that it won't be stolen, modified, or re-uploaded to a third party. 
                            <strong>BUT YOU</strong>, as the owner of YOUR work, can at any time report suspects to our support team or Discord, <strong>BUT</strong> it may take some time before the damage is repaired <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> if it is submitted to another side than ours. 
                            <strong>BUT</strong> you must be aware that even though it was you who made it and you who have the right and full license to do what you want with it and share it where you want and you who has the full license of the product you make and other content you share. 
                            <strong>BUT</strong> we have <strong>NO</strong> easy way to send a lawsuit to the suspect or any easy way to protect the owner of the artwork or send someone to help solve the issue. 
                            So <strong>YOU</strong> as the owner of <strong>YOUR</strong> artworks and as the seller will have to take responsibility to report any suspicions of breaching the licenses of YOUR products and other things on this website and on other websites where you share what you have made.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>AI Art</h4>
                        <p>
                            AI art or not AI art, you are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to upload, re-upload, edit, or sell images or other content that you do <strong>NOT</strong> own or have permission from the original owners.
                            But about AI protection, it's probably hard to tell who is making what and who is uploading what and where but the best way to find out is to report it to the admins of the site or our Discord server but it may take some time to go through.
                            <strong>BUT</strong> whenever you buy or sell artwork or any other products under the category of AI Art you have to make sure that the data and images that are used in its dataset and model are <strong>ONLY</strong> from volunteers that either donate some of their art or have gotten written permission from the original owner of the artwork.
                            If it is <strong>NOT</strong> from volunteers that either donate some of their art or have given written permission from the original owner of the artwork, it is <strong>NOT</strong> okay to try to upload, re-upload, edit, or sell images or other content that you do <strong>NOT</strong> own. Sorry, it is more safer that way.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>NFTs</h4>
                        <p>
                            NFTs or not NFTs, you are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed to upload, re-upload, edit, or sell images or other content that you do <strong>NOT</strong> own or have permission from the original owners.
                            But about NFTs protection, it's probably hard to tell who is making what and who is uploading what and where but the best way to find out is to report it to the admins of the site or our Discord server but it may take some time to go through.
                            Whenever you buy or sell artwork or any other products under the category of NFT(s) you make an action at your <strong>OWN</strong> risk on third-party marketplaces and are <strong>NOT</strong> in our control and we can <strong>NOT</strong> guarantee any protection against scammers or lost in investment or can <strong>NOT</strong> in any way pay you back or help.
                            NFT(s) marketing and investment are at your <strong>OWN</strong> risk and have <strong>NOTHING</strong> to do with us as a team or service.
                        </p>

            <li><h3>When the Side is in Alpha and Beta Versions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Alpha or Beta in General</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                When a version of the site is in an alpha state, the site is still in development, and new features are still being added along with some bug fixes, 
                                but it is still <strong>NOT</strong> stable yet, and safety is being worked on.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When a version of the site is in a beta state, the site is still in development, no more new features are being added,
                                and are more focused on stabilizing along with some more bug fixes, and it is more stable and safe, the side is <strong>NOT</strong> declared stable yet, and safety is still being worked on.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li><h4>The Risk of Using Early Access (Alpha and Beta Versions)</h4>
                        <p>
                            When a version of the website is in alpha or beta state and when <strong>YOU</strong> as an Alpha and Beta Tester get their test user so they can start testing the site's new functionality and features, 
                            there is a risk for <strong>YOU</strong> as a test user to experience unexpected behaviors on the site, like bugs and data loss that may be caused due to the site is being in its earliest stage and therefor <strong>NOT</strong> fully stabilized, 
                            therefor <strong>YOU</strong> as Alpha and Beta Tester should <strong>NOT</strong> expect perfection or even a stable user experience and therefor <strong>SHOLD</strong> be aware that, when there is adding new functionality and features to the site, 
                            there can be a time between early access and full release that can have some holes in the safety (both big and small) and can have some bugs with it that may brack the side that the test users are on. 
                            But we, as the developer team, are doing our best to fix any upcoming bogs and safety issues that may come across when new users signup to be Alpha and Beta Testers and get access to the site in its earliest state. 
                            we as the developers of the website will do our best to solve any problem with bugs and safety issues that may come across the route before full release so that in the future, they are as small as possible in the full release. 
                            So all you have to do as an Alpha and Beta Tester is to test our site and report any upcoming issues and bugs that you may find on our website to our Discord server and give us some feedback on what could be done better in the future.
