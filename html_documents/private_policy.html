                    <li><h4>General information about us</h4>
                        <p>
                            We, as a team and administrators of this website, 
                            know how to take care of our user's data and privacy, 
                            we will therefore <strong>NOT</strong> disclose to third parties or employees any sensitive information such as credit card information and personal address, email, 
                            or password associated with the user's account without additional reasons or responsibilities.<br/>
                            
                            <br/>As a team and administrators of this website, we do <strong>NOT</strong> use cookies or any other unnecessary data tracking without additional reasons or instructions. 
                            On this site, we only use things like sessions. 
                            Sessions are a type of temporary storage of data that is stored both on the user's device and on the website's server. 
                            In this case, it is most time used to save the user's login so that they still are logged in when they visit another website or when they in a short time close their device and come back after a short time.
                            Sessions will be deleted after 10 minutes and up to 24 hours of inactivity and will be deleted the next time a user tries to log in on the same device. 
                            <br/><strong>However, we will still strongly suggest that the user log out manually in the menu if they ganna be offline for a while.</strong><br/>
                            
                            <br/>When the user or another user on the page shares data, such as text and images and other types of submissions, that data is sent from the user's device to the website's server and then forwarded to other data services, 
                            such as AWS S3 <i>public data (shared between the users)</i> and our user data store <i>private data (<strong>NOT</strong> shared between the users)</i>.
                            
                            <br/>On this website, we can also occasionally collect data for statistical purposes. 
                            This does NOT include data like gender, age, geography, personal address, or other private information <i>private data (<strong>NOT</strong> shared between the users)</i>. 
                            Our statics contains the history of our users' activity and describe the posts the users see and click on and which feedback they give, such as faves, stars, and comments <i>public data (shared between the users)</i>.<br/>
